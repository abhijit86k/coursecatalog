syllabus: "Experiments to support study of the Internet protocol stack: (a) Experimental study of application protocols such as HTTP, FTP, SMTP, using network packet sniffers and analyzers such as Ethereal. Small exercises in socket programming in C/C++/Java. (b) Experiments with packet sniffers to study the TCP protocol. Using OS (netstat, etc) tools to understand TCP protocol FSM, retransmission timer behavior, congestion control behaviour. (c) Introduction to ns2 (network simulator) - small simulation exercises to study TCP behavior under different scenarios. (d) Setting up a small IP network - configure interfaces, IP addresses and routing protocols to set up a small IP network. Study dynamic behaviour using packet sniffers (e) Experiments with ns2 to study behaviour (especially performance of) link layer protocols such as Ethernet and 802.11 wireless LAN."
