description: "The MOS transistor is the core element of integrated circuit (IC) technology “Heart of VLSI circuit”. The bipolar transistors are used in amplifier, filter, and oscillator designs. The heterojunction transistors find applications in high-speed circuits, power switches, RF and Microwave electronics. These points signify the importance of studying the physics and technology of transistors."
