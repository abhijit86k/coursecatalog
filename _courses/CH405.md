syllabus: "Health and nutrition, role of different nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals), diet and metabolism, basic introduction to human physiology, communicable diseases (common bacterial and fungal infections, antibiotics and resistance, common viral infections, corona virus (SARS, MERS, SARS- COV-2), vaccine and antivirals, non-communicable diseases (diabetes, cancer), basic medicinal chemistry, preventative and community medicine, health policies, healthcare system, health awareness and best practices. This course is designed to spread awareness among students on the best practices to maintain a good health and to emphasize on the role of diet and nutrition. It will also encompass common diseases that we encounter often and various ways to prevent and mitigate them with the basic understanding of human physiology and medicinal chemistry. In the wake of this global COVID- 19 pandemic, fundamental information on good health and community medicine as well as healthcare system/policies has become indispensable. This course will provide the necessary foundation on the mechanism of various commonly used drugs, preventative medicine, and suitable family health practices which will facilitate one in making informed decisions on prevention, diagnosis, treatment, care, and support when required."
