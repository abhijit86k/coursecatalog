syllabus: "Syllabus is divided roughly 8 modules; each module roughly takes two weeks. Module 1: Introduction Examples and  motivation. Asymptotic complexity: informal concepts, formal notation, examples Module 2: Searching in list: binary search,  Sorting: insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quicksort, stability and other issues. Module 3: Divide and conquer: binary search, recurrence relations. nearest pair of points, merge sort, integer multiplication, matrix  multiplication.  Module 4: Graphs: Motivation, BFS, DFS, DFS numbering and applications, directed acyclic graphs, directed acyclic graphs, Shortest paths: unweighted and weighted, Single source shortest paths: Dijkstra, Minimum cost spanning trees: Prim’s algorithm, Kruskal’s Algorithm Module 5: Union-Find data structure, Priority queues, heaps. Heap sort. Dijstra/Prims revisited using heaps, Search Trees: Introduction Traversals, insertions, deletions Balancing Module 6: Greedy algorithms: Greedy: Interval scheduling, Proof strategies, Huffman coding. Module 7: Dynamic Programming: weighted interval scheduling, memoization, edit distance, longest ascending subsequence. matrix multiplication, shortest paths: Bellman Ford, shortest paths: Floyd Warshall Module 8: Intractability: NP completeness, reductions, examples, Misc topics."
