name: Introduction to Computational Fluid Dynamics 
type: Theory
description: "CFD is an integral part of the design process in mechanical,  aerospace, and chemical industries, as well as a topic of active  research. Training at the undergraduate and early-postgraduate level will enable students to take advantage of opportunities in  these areas. The course aims to provide an introduction to discretization  and solution of the equations of fluid dynamics and heat  transfer. Students will gain an appreciation of the principles of  the finite-volume method, experience in writing and debugging scientific codes, and solving and analysing a problem using a commercial/open-source package. Students should expect to devote significant time to learning via coding assignments and project. "
