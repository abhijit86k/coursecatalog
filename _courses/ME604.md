title: ME604
department: Mechanical Engineering
name: Multiphase Flow
type: Theory
description: "This is a postgraduate level course that covers few fundamental aspects of multiphase flows. Understanding multiphase flow is essentialin many industrial applications. For example, starting from the petroleum industry, food processing industry, ink-jet printing to the manufacturing of self-cleaning devices, painting and coating processes involve multiphase flow. The course can be offered as an elective course in B.Tech/M.Tech./MS/Ph.D. to Mechanical and Chemical Engineering Departments. "
