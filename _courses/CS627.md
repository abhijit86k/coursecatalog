name: Runtime Verification
type: Theory
description: "The world we live in is increasingly automated. However, systems are prone to misbehavior. Increasing complexity of systems and time-to-market pressures result in design bugs. Manufacturing at aggressively small technology nodes leads to defects and greater rate of wearing. Software and Hardware Trojans are increasingly being employed by malicious players to attack systems. Runtime verification is a young, promising class of techniques aimed at countering all of the above. This course will serve to detail the various capabilities and limitations of this class of techniques."
