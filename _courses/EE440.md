description: "Solving optimization problem is a key ingredient of any data science/Machine Learning (ML) task. It is important to understand how to state problem of practical interests in the language of optimization, and solve it. This course aims to achieve this goal by providing theory and algorithms to solve optimization problems that arise in typical ML problems."
