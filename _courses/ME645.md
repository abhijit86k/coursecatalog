title: ME645
department: Mechanical Engineering
name: "Modeling of metal plasticity: discrete and continuum approaches"
type: Theory
description: "Metal plasticity is inherently a multiscale phenomenon where information bridges must be established between different length and time scales for the accurate description of the deformation behavior of metals and alloys suitable for engineering applications. In the same spirit, this course is designed to provide a brief introduction to plasticity at two  different length scales i.e. discrete dislocation dynamics and continuum plasticity models currently used to simulate dislocation mediated plasticity in metals and alloys. In addition, a special emphasis is given  on the explicit scale bridging between these two length scales."
