title: PH203
department: Physics
name: Quantum Mechanics - I
type: Theory
description: "This course concentrates on developing the postulates that governs the quantum physics, some necessary tools to understand the behavior of quantum systems, introduces the Dirac’s formalism to quantum mechanics, and addresses the understanding of some physical systems at quantum level. In the first course of quantum physics, through PH101, the students are introduced to various basic aspects of quantum systems. Which was more generic in nature, however, this course tries to make the learning of quantum mechanics streamlined and deal with exact physics systems."
