layout: course 
title: ME445
department: Mechanical Engineering
name: Introduction to Aerospace Materials
type: Theory
description: "This course provides an introduction to the science and engineering of the materials used in aircraft, helicopters and spacecrafts, Rockets etc. The topic of aerospace materials is core to aerospace engineering. The focus of this course is the structural materials used in the main structures (e.g. fuselage, wings, landing gear, control surfaces) and the propulsion systems (e.g. jet engines, helicopter rotor blades). The reason to focus on structural materials is due to their major influence on the cost, performance and overall safety of the aircraft."
