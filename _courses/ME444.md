department: Mechanical Engineering
name: Aerodynamics
type: Theory
description: "Aerodynamics is the study of the air flowing over a body, which is typically an aircraft or automobile, to determine the forces and moments acting on it. The study of aerodynamics is essential to design and analyze various components of aircraft and automobile systems as well as certain civil structures, with the aim to propose alternate designs with improved performance. Learners of this course will understand the fundamental concepts of aerodynamics and use them to calculate the aerodynamic forces acting on simplified as well as realistic geometries."
